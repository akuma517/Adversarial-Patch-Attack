The patch detection is done using the image statistics.
The image is adjusted using the brightness and contrast parameters. 
The adjusted image is then used in further processing.
The entire image is divided into rectangular regions and the standard deviation is calculated.
Based on the standarad deviation a binary mask is created which is applied on the original image.
The masked generated by putting a condition on standard deviation is ireegular in nature and also 
dependent on block size. It is found that for GTSRB dataset, the best masks are obtained when rectangular
regions are generation using 5x5 blocks. The OTSU's thresholding method is applied on the adjusted grayscale image to obtain a threshold value.
This threshold is then used on the grayscale converetd resulting mask image to generate the contours of the image. The rectangular
bounding boxes are generated using countours and only those rectangles are considers whose area falls in
range of (200 = 900*(9/2),360 = 900 *(2/5)). This range is estimated considering the fact that adversarial
patches are put such that they don't cover most of the area of the image. The square box is generated 
around the region where all the conditions are fullfilled taking into account the lowest of either 
width or height of the rectangle.
