# Adversarial-Patch-Attack

Traffic Sign Recognition conatins the src code.
There are 4 files: 
  1. Utils.py : For future use, change the path where you want to save the loss.png, accuracy.png and model file.
  2. model.py : Contains model details
  3. dataset.py: DataSet and Data Loader : Update the path and point it to the location where the training files are present.
  4. train.py : File for execution. The args parameters are use to run the file.

Remark: For the time being, I am running the Model using  Google Colab and storing the outputs in the Google drive.
